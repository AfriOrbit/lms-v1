*Satellite* derives from the Latin **satellit** — an attendant, one who
is constantly hovering around and attending to a master. The technical
definition is deliberately plain:

> A satellite is simply a body that moves around another (usually much
> larger) body in a mathematically predictable path called an orbit.

## Classification by mass

This ladder is worth memorising, because almost every trade study you
will do refers to it:

| Class | Mass |
|---|---|
| Large satellites | More than 1,000 kg |
| Medium-sized satellites | 500–1,000 kg |
| **Small satellites** | **< 500 kg** |
| — Minisatellite | 100–500 kg |
| — Microsatellite | 10–100 kg |
| — **Nanosatellite** | **1–10 kg** |
| — Picosatellite | Less than 1 kg |
| — Femtosatellite | 10 g – 100 g |
| — Attosatellite | 1 g – 10 g |
| — Zeptosatellite | 0.1 g – 1 g |

A 1U CubeSat sits in the **nanosatellite** band. A 3U sits there too.
This matters for launch brokerage, for regulatory treatment, and for
which parts of the literature apply to you.

**Sputnik 1** — launched 4 October 1957 by the Council of Ministers of
the USSR, principal contractor OKB 1. Mass **83 kg**, orbit
**215 × 939 km**, mission: atmospheric studies for three months. It
completed **1,440 orbits** and decayed on 4 January 1958.

**Vanguard 1** (United States, 1958) carried two continuous-wave
transmitters and monitored internal temperatures and total integrated
electron density. It is also the first solar-powered spacecraft:
**6 panels producing 1 W at 10% efficiency**.

Small satellites, in other words, *started* the space programme. The
large-satellite era came afterwards.

## Three eras

- **Early Space Era** — small spacecraft, rapid iteration.
- **Large Space Era** (roughly 1968 to the mid-1990s) — capability
  through mass and budget.
- **New Space Era** (1997 onwards) — the return of the small
  spacecraft, this time with commercial economics.

## Where CubeSats come from

The lineage runs through Stanford's **OPAL** picosatellite launcher to
**Prof. Bob Twiggs** (Stanford) and **Prof. Jordi Puig-Suari** (Cal
Poly), who defined the CubeSat standard so that student projects could
share a deployer and a ride.

The insight was not the cube. It was **standardising the interface** so
that the launch problem stopped being negotiated per mission.

## Kenya

Kenya's space history is older than most people expect. The **San Marco
/ Broglio Space Centre off Malindi** conducted orbital launches from a
sea platform from 1967 — the closest any orbital launch site has been
to the equator. That lineage runs forward to the **Kenya Space Agency**
and to **1KUNS-PF**, Kenya's first CubeSat.

## Beyond the CubeSat

The form-factor landscape now also includes **PocketQubes**, **TubeSats**
and **SunCubes** — smaller standards chasing the same idea.

  perform app.seed_lesson(v_module, 'lifecycle-and-reviews', 'The lifecycle and its review gates',
    'reading', 25, 1, $md$## Why phases exist

A mission phase is a commitment checkpoint. You are not allowed to
spend the next phase's money until a review says the previous phase is
genuinely finished. The two standards you will meet:

**ECSS-M-ST-10C** (European, used widely in CubeSat work):

| Phase | Activity | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Mission analysis / needs identification | MCR |
| A | Feasibility | SDR |
| B | Preliminary definition | **PDR** |
| C | Detailed definition | **CDR** |
| D | Qualification and production | FRR |
| E | Utilization | — |
| F | Disposal | — |

**NASA** uses Pre-Phase A through Phase E/F with KDPs (key decision
points) and the review set SRR, **SDR/MDR**, **PDR**, **CDR**, **SIR**.

## Verification is not validation

- **Verification** — did we build the thing right? Against requirements.
- **Validation** — did we build the right thing? Against the mission need.

A CubeSat can pass every verification test and still fail validation,
which is how you end up with a spacecraft that works perfectly and
produces data nobody wanted.

    'reading', 20, 2, $md$## The law

> **Shea's Law:** The ability to improve a design occurs primarily at
> the interfaces. This is also the prime location for screwing it up.

## Why interfaces dominate failures

Much effort is spent designing individual parts of a system —
functionality, tolerances, mean-time-between-failure. Interfaces are
often neglected and become the weak points: bottlenecks, structural
failures, erroneous function calls.

The deck's argument, condensed:

- Complex systems have many interfaces.
- Common interfaces reduce complexity.
- System architecture drives which interface types get used.
- Clear interface identification and definition reduces risk.
- **Most of the problems in systems are at the interfaces.**
- Verification of all interfaces is critical for compatibility.

## The documents

- **IRD** — Interface Requirements Document. Defines functional,
  performance, electrical, environmental, human and physical
  requirements at a boundary between two or more elements. Covers both
  logical and physical interfaces.
- **ICD** — Interface Control Document (NASA approach).
- **DSM** — Design Structure Matrix, for seeing the interface topology
  of the whole system at once.

## Team structure

The KSA programme organises a student CubeSat team as: leadership and
coordination, faculty mentors, then a **Project Management / Systems
Engineering / Team Lead** role over subsystem leads for **OBC & FSW,
COMMS, ADCS & Mission, EPS, Payload, Structures and Thermal**.

Note that interface management is the systems engineer's job precisely
because no subsystem lead owns the boundary.

> The Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS) provides, stores, distributes,
> and controls spacecraft electrical power.

Its seven top-level functions, as stated in the source:

1. Supply power over mission life
2. Control and distribute power
3. Support average and peak load
4. Provide convertors for AC and regulated DC power buses
5. Provide command and telemetry capability for EPS health and status
6. Protect payload against EPS failures
7. Suppress transient bus voltages and protect against bus faults

## The four blocks

```
Power Source → Energy Storage → Power Distribution → Power Regulation & Control
```

> In most cases the power distribution and power regulation and control
> unit are combined in the same hardware called the Power Control Unit
> (PCU) / PCDU.

## Why this subsystem gets special attention

The failure statistics are not subtle:

- **Over 25% of all spacecraft failures on orbit result from EPS failures.**
- Over a satellite's total life, insurance costs are nearly **33% of
  total project costs**, and about **50% of insurance claims relate to EPS**.
- A study of power-related failures 1990–2013 analysed **158 power-subsystem
  incidents**. **50%** comprised degradation or component failure.
  **51 incidents** were major — a power decrease of 50% or more of BOL,
  or loss of the satellite. Estimated total loss: **8.8 billion dollars**.

Three routes to improvement are offered: better design, additional
redundancies, improved testing procedures.

Specific power and specific cost dominate the selection. The families,
with the efficiencies quoted in the source:

| Family | Efficiency |
|---|---|
| Thermoelectric (static) | 5–8% |
| Thermionic (static) | 10–20% |
| Rankine cycle (dynamic) | 15–20% |
| Brayton cycle (dynamic) | 20–35% |
| Stirling cycle (dynamic) | 25–30% |
| Fuel cells | 80% at low current, 50–60% at high current |

Fuel cells reach high specific power — **275 W/kg on the Space Shuttle** —
but for our class of mission:

> Often, PV sources are the only real candidates for low-power missions (<15 kW).

## Cell technology

- Crystalline silicon: 2013 record lab cell efficiency **25.6%**
- Single-crystalline GaAs: **29.1%** (2019), the highest single-junction
- Multijunction (c-Si, InGaP, GaAs, Ge, InGaAs): maximum theoretical **33.16%**;
  a European record of **39.7%** is noted
- Thin film: CdTe, CIGS, amorphous silicon (a-Si, TF-Si)

For scale: the **ISS has eight solar array wings, each 35 m × 12 m,
generating 120 kW average power each.**

Grouped as **physical** (size, weight, configuration, operating position,
static and dynamic environments), **electrical** (voltage, current
loading, duty cycles, activation time, storage time, limits on depth of
discharge) and **programmatic** (cost, mission, reliability,
maintainability, producibility).

Energy density is quoted two ways: **gravimetric** in W·h/kg and
**volumetric** in W·h/l.

## Primary versus secondary

Primary cells — silver zinc, thermal cells, lithium sulphur dioxide —
are not rechargeable. Secondary cells are, for **thousands of cycles**.
A CubeSat uses secondary cells; the interesting question is which
chemistry.

## Three design rules worth internalising

> We desire a flat discharge curve that extends most of the capacity.

> Little overcharge quickly degrades most batteries.

> Charge imbalances degrade batteries.

The third is why cell balancing is a BMS requirement and not a nicety.

## Lithium-ion

G.N. Lewis worked on lithium in 1912. Rechargeable metallic-lithium
attempts in the 1980s failed because of *instabilities in the metallic
lithium used as anode material*. Sony commercialised the modern cell in
**1991**.

Chemistries: LiCoO₂ (LCO), LiMn₂O₄ (LMO), LiNiMnCoO₂ (NMC),
LiFePO₄ (LFP), LiNiCoAlO₂ (NCA), Li₂TiO₃ (LTO).

The workhorse cell format: the **18650** measures **18 mm diameter ×
65 mm length**, nominal **3.7 V**, and high-energy-density versions
now deliver **over 3000 mAh**.

Two limitations that shape spacecraft design:

> Requires protection circuit to prevent thermal runaway if stressed.

> No rapid charge possible at freezing temperatures (< 0 °C, < 32 °F).

The second is why battery heaters appear in the EPS block diagram.

    'reading', 30, 1, $md$## Beta angle

**β** is the smaller angle between the Sun vector and the spacecraft's
orbit plane. It varies through the year with the right ascension of the
Sun (Γ) and with nodal regression (Ω):

$$\beta = \sin^{-1}\left(\cos\Gamma\sin\Omega\sin i + \sin\Gamma\cos\varepsilon\cos\Omega\sin i + \sin\Gamma\sin\varepsilon\cos i\right)$$

where Γ is the right ascension of the Sun and ε its declination.

## Eclipse fraction

$$F = \frac{1}{\pi}\cos^{-1}\frac{\sqrt{h^{2} + 2R_{e}h}}{(R_{e}+h)\cos\beta}$$

Three design points follow directly:

- **For LEO the maximum eclipse duration remains close to 35 minutes.**
- Orbits with **90° < i < 120°** have a lower average eclipse duration
  over the year than orbits at lower inclination.
- For a particular inclination, the range of β remains constant at any
  altitude.

That first number is the one you carry around: a LEO CubeSat has to
survive roughly **35 minutes in the dark, every orbit, forever**.

    'reading', 30, 2, $md$## The whole subsystem in one line

$$\text{Power Budget} = \text{OAP} - \text{Average Power Used}$$

**OAP** is orbit average power. Its inputs are cell efficiency η (and
*this efficiency at BOL ≠ at EOL*), effective cell area A_eff, the solar
constant C_s, and MPPT converter efficiency η_conv.

The solar constant is not a constant: **minimum 1321 W/m², mean
1358 W/m², maximum 1413 W/m²**.

## A rule of thumb, and a warning

> OAP = 60% × Power from one panel

> However, it is important to verify these results using other methods.

Use the rule to sanity-check, never to size.

## Consumption

Built from **duty cycle** (the ratio of on time to off time), the
satellite's **operating modes**, per-mode power requirements, and
**margins** — *the greater the uncertainty, the higher the margin*.

Four operating modes:

1. **Deployment** — UHF communication and EPS initialised
2. **Mission / Nominal**
3. **Safe** — payload off, batteries recharge
4. **Survival / Critical**

## The two rules that decide whether you have a spacecraft

> A CubeSat launched with a known negative power budget is 'space debris'.

> Make sure you can switch OFF non-essential subsystems and payloads.

A **positive** power budget means power generated over one orbit is
greater than or equal to power consumed over that orbit. Negative means
the reverse, and it is terminal unless the second rule was designed in.

Step 2's variables: **P_e, P_d** — spacecraft power requirement during
eclipse and daylight; **T_e, T_d** — the lengths of those periods per
orbit; **X_e, X_d** — the efficiency of the path from array through
battery to load, and from array direct to load.

## Degradation, in two kinds

**Inherent degradation (I_d)** — design inefficiencies, shadowing,
temperature variations. Plus the **cosine loss**, cos θ, where θ is the
sun incidence angle.

**Life degradation** — thermal cycling in and out of eclipse,
micrometeoroid strikes, plume impingement from thrusters, material
outgassing. Budget **2–3% per year in LEO**.

Datasheet numbers are quoted at **25 °C and 1000 W/m²**. Your cells will
be at neither.

## Three steps for the battery

1. Determine energy storage requirements
2. Select type of secondary battery
3. Determine the size of the batteries (battery capacity)

The sizing variables: **P_e T_e** (average eclipse load × eclipse
duration), **N** (number of batteries), **η** (battery-to-load
efficiency), and **DoD**:

> Depth of discharge — the capacity that is discharged from a fully
> charged battery, divided by battery nominal capacity, expressed as a
> percentage.

> **Source note.** The array and battery sizing equations are images in
> the original deck and did not extract. The variable definitions above

**Peak Power Tracking** is non-dissipative — it extracts the exact power
the spacecraft requires, up to the array's peak power.

> A PPT has advantages for missions under 5 years that require more
> power at BOL than at EOL.

**Direct Energy Transfer** is dissipative, using shunt resistors.

> A shunt-regulated subsystem has advantages: fewer parts, lower mass,
> and higher total efficiency at EOL.

## Three bus classes

- **Unregulated** — bus voltage = battery voltage
- **Quasi-regulated** — regulated during charge only; the voltage is
  about a diode drop below the battery; low efficiency and high EMI if
  used with a PPT
- **Fully regulated** — employs charge and discharge regulators; the
  most complex, with inherent low efficiency and high EMI when used with
  a PPT or boost converter

## The unloading function

This is the most important paragraph in the course.

The PCDU provides over-current protection, load management, and battery
under-voltage protection. **All subsystems and payloads must be
switched individually.** A software safety task monitors state of charge
and shuts subsystems down in priority order; a hardware absolute-minimum
battery voltage backs that task up.

> Without the Unloading Function, the spacecraft will remain in a
> negative power budget and will never recover!

Never recover. Not "will degrade". There is no ground command that fixes
a spacecraft whose radio cannot power on.

4. **Schematic review** — checklist-driven, and iterative
5. **Generate the schematic netlist**

## Choosing components

Manufacturer and part number, package type and size, electrical and
mechanical ratings and tolerances, operating conditions, vendor options,
active status and support, availability and stock, price, and
alternatives. Named distributors: Digi-Key, Mouser, Arrow, RS
Components, Newark.

## Standards you will actually cite

- **IPC-7351B** — generic requirements for surface mount design and land
  patterns. Used for both routing and production.
- **IPC J-STD-001** — soldering requirements.
- **IPC-6012** — board classes 1/2/3. *Class 3 is a standard requirement
  for military, medical, and aerospace equipment.*
- **IPC-2152** — implemented by the free Saturn PCB Design Toolkit.

## Form factor

> All electronic boards must measure 3.550 × 3.775 in (90 × 96 mm), and
> the electric bus must allocate four rows with 26 contacts of standard
> 0.1 inch spacing through-hole headers.

That is **PC/104**, and all the boards stack into a 1U volume.

- Rated radiation dose of **100 krad to > 1 Mrad**

  behind cutting edge**
- No supplier stock, long lead times, high cost

## COTS

> Hardware and software that is commercially made and available to the
> general public and that requires little or no unique modifications.

And the warning that matters:

> COTS components does not always mean space qualified components.

The selection checklist: look at test results, examine problem reports,
evaluate user documentation, look at product support, check TRL.

**TRL** is *a description of the performance history of a given system,
subsystem, or component relative to a set of levels first described at
NASA HQ in the 1980s.*

## Firmware

The EPS MCU needs low power consumption, sufficient internal program
memory, a small footprint, flexible design, and suitability for the space
environment — **temperature tolerance between −40 °C and +80 °C**.

Peripherals in play: ADC for sensor, voltage and current measurement;
**PWM to drive MOSFET switching — very common in the EPS**; timers; and
a watchdog:

> If the EPS becomes unresponsive, a reset signal is the only way to
> recover normal operations. This is where a watchdog timer comes handy.

Frameworks named: **CMSIS** (vendor-independent abstraction for Arm
Cortex) and **FreeRTOS** (ported to 35 MCU platforms).

- Recording and storage of telemetry and satellite payload data
- Encoding and decoding of data packets to and from the ground station
- Processing of commands from the ground station
- Monitoring other subsystems
- Implementing watchdog functions
- Controlling the orientation of the satellite within its orbit

## Three topologies

**Centralized** — a central node connected directly with the remaining
nodes. *Best solution for small systems*; *errors will not affect other
nodes*.

**Ring** — each node connected with only two others. *Less harness and
the data bus can be kept simple*; *new nodes can be added easily*.

**Bus** — all nodes share a common data bus, managed by a protocol.
*High reliability*; *loss of one or more nodes does not affect the
communication between the remaining nodes*.

## Centralized versus distributed processing

Centralized means one OBC interfacing with all subsystems and doing all
the processing — possibly as a processor pool. Distributed means some
subsystems have their own processing power:

> A failure does not affect the complete system. Very critical functions
> should run in different processors to avoid interferences.

## What space demands

Vacuum changes thermal management. The temperature range is
**−170 °C to +120 °C**. Launch brings extreme vibration. And then:

> Hardware can't be repaired.

Which produces the rest of the requirement list: reliability, limited
resources, self-healing (*ability to recover automatically*), remote
diagnosis, fault tolerance, high computing performance, software uploads.

Modularity, portability, extensibility, reliability, and **scalability**
— defined here specifically for *operation of nanosatellite missions in
a constellation with an increasing number of satellites*.

## Deriving requirements

The course works one example end to end. Mission requirement:

> To capture images over Nairobi area

Three flight software functional requirements follow:

1. Store and download telemetry data
2. Execute self-generated commands
3. Execute commands generated from ground satellite operators

Note that none of those mention imaging. They are what the *software*
must do so that imaging is possible.

## The component checklist

Twenty modules a complete FSW design needs: telemetry collection,
telemetry transmission, telemetry storage, fault management, watchdog
interface, command service, activity scheduler, time management,
messaging service, remote communication, communication interface,
parameter database interface, file system interface, log collection,
utilities (checksum, encoding/decoding, compression), debugging support
and testing support.

## RTOS

Kernel services: task management, I/O management, interrupt and event
handling, timer management, memory management, communication management.
Key features: safety, reliability, multitasking and speed.

## Service-oriented, not master/slave

Seven advantages are listed, ending with the one that matters:

> Reduces single point of failure: the complexity is moved from a single
> master node to several well defined services on the network.

## Code quality

> Clear code rules, code reviews and code test.

> Code should be tested by a second developer.

Phase B produces five budgets: **mass, power, link, data, thermal**.
This is the data one.

It has two parts. **Telemetry packet budget** — *each sensor generates
different housekeeping data depending on the sensor's nature,
measurement accuracy and sampling rate.* **Payload data budget** — for a
camera: image sensor type (panchromatic, multispectral, hyperspectral),
resolution, frame rate, bits per pixel, compression rate.

## The worked exercise

This is reproduced from the course exactly, because it is the single
most useful calculation in the module.

> Our mission is to capture images over land to detect forest fires. The
> sensor will only be active about 30% of each orbit. Our satellite is at
> an altitude of 500 km and will have a period of 90 minutes. We have a
> 1024 × 1024 pixel detector and assume that we need 8 bits to accurately
> record each pixel. To ensure we achieve the required coverage, we will
> collect an image about every 30 seconds. Our on-board processor will
> review and reject some images with low probability of having a forest
> fire (about 95%). All of the remaining images must be down-linked
> during a 15 min pass over a ground station. To allow additional margin
> at least 3 orbits worth of data must be saved and downloaded during a
> pass.

### Method

```
Data per image      = (pixels wide) × (pixels long) × (bits per pixel)
Images saved/orbit  = (orbital period) × (image rate) × (% sensor active) × (% not rejected)
Max data bits       = (number of orbits) × (images per orbit) × (data per image)
Min data rate       = (max data bits) / (pass time)
```

### Answer

```
Data per image     = 1024 × 1024 × 8       = 8.389 × 10⁶ bits
Images per orbit   = 90 × 2 × 0.30 × 0.05  = 2.7 → 3 images
Max data bits      = 3 × 3 × 8.389 × 10⁶   = 7.55 × 10⁷ bits
Max data bytes     = 7.55 × 10⁷ / 8        = 9.437 × 10⁶ bytes
Min data rate      = 7.55 × 10⁷ / 900 s    = 8.389 × 10⁴ bits/s
```

### Two things to notice

The **500 km altitude is never used**. It is there to make the problem
feel real, and to see whether you notice. Real requirement documents do
this constantly.

And **2.7 rounds up to 3**, not down. You size storage for the worst
case, not the average.

  perform app.seed_lesson(v_module, 'radiation', 'Radiation effects and error handling',
    'reading', 25, 2, $md$## Two families

**Long-term accumulative**

- **TID** — total ionizing dose. *Cumulative long term ionizing damage
  due to protons and electrons.* Ionization creates electron-hole pairs;
  accumulated positive charge builds up in insulators and oxides.
  Effects: threshold voltage shift, leakage current, functional failures.
  Mitigation: shielding.
- **DDD** — displacement damage dose. *Cumulative long term non-ionizing
  damage due to protons, electrons and neutrons.* Affects opto-couplers,
  solar cells, CCDs, linear bipolar devices. Mitigation: shielding.

**Short-term / transient**

- **SEE** — single event effects, which *result from ionization by a
  single charged particle passage through a MOS transistor and through
  the junction of a bipolar transistor*. Non-destructive: **single event
  upset (SEU)**. Destructive: **single event latch-up (SEL)**.

Mitigation for SEE happens at three levels: parts level (*maximize
critical charge required for an upset*), circuit level (*on-board error
detection and correction*), system level (*add filters to suppress
propagation of fast transients*).

## Designing around COTS

> COTS microcontrollers do not support internal error detection and
> handling. Protection mechanism has to be implemented with external
> hardware.

> If the processor crashes, a watchdog timer can detect the event and
> reset the system.

> A triple redundancy allows the detection and correction of an error.

Memory error detection: parity, EDAC code, CRC at block level, multiple
copies of data.

**FRAM** is worth knowing: *more tolerant to radiation than FLASH cells.
It uses 99% less power than a DRAM memory and has a higher temperature
operation range.*

## Test before you fly

Four tests named: command execution test; **day-in-the-life test**,
where a typical 24-hour on-orbit period is simulated; end-to-end
communications test; and a **complete power system charge cycle**, where
the battery is discharged to full depth of discharge through satellite
operations and then recharged using the solar panels.

LoRa gives you four parameters, and every link decision is some
combination of them.

**Spreading factor (SF7–SF12).** Each step up roughly doubles airtime
and adds about 2.5 dB of link budget. Higher SF reaches further and
carries less.

**Bandwidth (125 / 250 / 500 kHz).** Wider is faster and less sensitive.

**Coding rate (4/5 to 4/8).** Forward error correction. More redundancy
survives more interference and costs more airtime.

**Transmit power.** On the Ra-02, up to about 20 dBm.

## The trade, in numbers

From AfriOrbit's own LoRa notes:

| Configuration | Approximate data rate |
|---|---|
| SF7, 500 kHz | ≈ 300 kbps |
| SF12, 125 kHz | ≈ 0.29 kbps |

That is a factor of about **a thousand** between the fastest and the
longest-reaching configuration on the same radio.

## Expected range

Also from the project's notes:

| Environment | Range |
|---|---|
| Urban | 5–10 km |
| Suburban | 10–20 km |
| Rural, line of sight | 20–30+ km |

## The longest-range recipe

The project documents this configuration explicitly:

> BW 125 kHz, SF12, CR 4/5, 17–20 dBm, AGC on

## Packet overhead

Every packet carries **8 bytes of preamble + 1 byte header + 2 bytes CRC
= 11 bytes of overhead**. On a 20-byte payload that is a 55% tax. The
project's own worked figure: a **266-byte packet takes 7.31 seconds** to
transmit at the long-range settings.

Seven and a third seconds. For one packet. That number is why duty-cycle
regulations exist and why satellite IoT is a scheduling problem before it
is a radio problem.

From the project's fabrication BOM:

| Role | Part |
|---|---|
| Microcontroller | **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8** (16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM) |
| Radio | **Ai-Thinker Ra-02**, based on **Semtech SX1278**, 410–525 MHz, SPI, U.FL |
| Power management | **IP5306** battery management |
| Regulator | **AMS1117-3.3** (1 A, 3.3 V, SOT-223) |
| Environmental sensor | **Bosch BME280** — humidity, pressure, temperature, LGA-8 |
| Storage | Hirose **DM3D-SF** microSD socket |
| ESD protection | **SP0503BAHT**, 5.5 V standoff, 3 channels |
| RTC crystal | **WE-XTAL-85SMX**, 32.768 kHz |

Four copper layers — the fabrication outputs include separate `GND` and
`PWR` gerbers alongside `F_Cu` and `B_Cu`.

## How the radio is wired

Taken from the PCB netlist, which is the authoritative source:

| ESP32-S3 pin | Net |
|---|---|
| IO9 | CS_LORA |
| IO11 | MOSI_LORA |
| IO12 | SCLK_LORA |
| IO13 | MISO_LORA |
| IO14 | RESET |
| IO3 | IRQ1 (DIO0 — RxDone/TxDone) |
| IO41 / IO42 | IRQ2 / IRQ3 (DIO1 / DIO2) |

The microSD is on a **separate SPI bus** — IO35/36/37 with CS on IO10 —
in 1-bit SPI mode, not 4-bit SDIO.

## A caution that is itself the lesson

The project's README files and the firmware and the PCB **do not all
agree** about pin assignments. The README for the SD card documents
GPIO 12/13/11/10; the firmware uses 36/37/35/10; the PCB agrees with the
firmware.

When documentation and hardware disagree, the hardware is right. Read the
netlist. This happens on real projects constantly, and being the engineer
who checks is worth more than being the engineer who assumes.

  perform app.seed_lesson(v_module, 'firmware-config', 'The firmware''s radio configuration',
    'reading', 25, 2, $md$## The defaults, as shipped

From `include/Comms/LoraComms.h`:

```cpp
struct LoRaBaseConfig {
  long frequency       = 433E6;   // Hz
  int  spreadingFactor = 7;
  long signalBandwidth = 500E3;   // Hz
  int  codingRate      = 5;       // 4/5
  int  syncWord        = 0x12;
  bool invertIQ        = false;
  int  preambleLength  = 8;
  bool enableCRC       = false;
};
```

Transmit adds `txPower = 2` dBm, `currentLimit = 100` mA,
`overCurrentProtection = 150` mA. Receive adds `gain = -1` (AGC),
`continousMode = false`, `rssiThreshold = -100` dBm.

## Read that configuration critically

This is the **fastest, shortest-range** corner of the trade space:
SF7 at 500 kHz. Compare it against the long-range recipe in the previous
module — BW 125 kHz, SF12, 17–20 dBm — and note that the shipped default
is the opposite of it, at **2 dBm** transmit power.

That is a sensible bench default and a poor field default. Knowing which
you are looking at is the point of this lesson.

Two more things the code tells you, if you read the comments:

- `begin()` hardcodes `LoRa.begin(433E6)` in the receive path with an
  inline `// @TODO: use _frequency`. The configurable frequency is not
  actually plumbed through on that branch.
- `receive()` carries the comment *"Current implementation has numerous
  losses. Some messages get lost"*.

Both are honest notes from the author, and both are real work items.
Reading a codebase for its TODOs is a skill.

## Frequency, and a discrepancy worth resolving

The firmware and the hardware use **433 MHz**. The repository README
states *868 MHz for Africa*. These cannot both be right for a deployed
system, and the answer depends on national spectrum regulation — in
Kenya, on the Communications Authority's licence-exempt allocations.

Resolving that is a real engineering task, not a documentation tidy-up.

## Two idioms you will see throughout

```cpp
Serial.begin(115200);
while (!Serial) delay(10);
```

and the fail-fast guard:

```cpp
if (!sensor.begin()) {
  Serial.println("Sensor not found");
  while (1) delay(10);
}
```

That second pattern is deliberate. A flight computer that boots with a
dead sensor and flies anyway produces a log full of zeros and a wasted
flight. Better to refuse to arm.

Sketch 3 blinks two LEDs — one at 100 ms, one at 300 ms. Try to write
that with `delay()` and you cannot. The two intervals do not divide into
a single sleep.

```cpp
const unsigned long BLINK_INTERVAL  = 100;
const unsigned long BLINK_INTERVAL2 = 300;

unsigned long previousMillis  = 0;
unsigned long previousMillis2 = 0;

void loop() {
  unsigned long now = millis();

  if (now - previousMillis >= BLINK_INTERVAL) {
    previousMillis = now;
    digitalWrite(LED, !digitalRead(LED));
  }
  if (now - previousMillis2 >= BLINK_INTERVAL2) {
    previousMillis2 = now;
    digitalWrite(LED2, !digitalRead(LED2));
  }
}
```

## Why this is the rocketry lesson, not a style preference

At apogee your flight computer needs to detect a pressure inflection,
fire a recovery charge, and keep logging. If it is inside a `delay(500)`
when apogee happens, it misses it.

The subtraction form `now - previous >= interval` also survives the
`millis()` rollover at about 49 days, which the naive
`now >= previous + interval` does not. Not a concern on a two-minute
flight; a real concern on a ground station.

  perform app.seed_lesson(v_module, 'i2c-discovery', 'Finding devices on the bus',
    'reading', 20, 1, $md$## Why the scanner comes before the drivers

Sketch 6 is an I2C scanner, and it is deliberately placed **before** any
sensor library. You are meant to find the addresses yourself:

```cpp
for (address = 1; address < 127; address++) {
  Wire.beginTransmission(address);
  error = Wire.endTransmission();
  if (error == 0) {
    Serial.print("I2C device found at address 0x");
    ...
  }
}
```

On this hardware you will find two:

- **0x76** — BMP280 (pressure and temperature)
- **0x68** — MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope)

Both sensors share one bus. That is why the scanner matters: when a
sensor stops responding in the field, the scanner tells you in seconds
whether it is a wiring problem or a software problem.

## A note on 0x76 versus 0x77

The BMP280 has two possible addresses selected by the SDO pin. The
AfriOrbit firmware calls `bmp.begin(0x76)` explicitly. The library's
alternate constant is present in the source but commented out. If your
breakout ties SDO high, you need 0x77 and the scanner will tell you.

---

    false, null);
  perform app.seed_lesson(v_module, 'configuring-sensors', 'Configuring the BMP280 and MPU6050',
    'reading', 30, 2, $md$## BMP280 — oversampling and filtering

```cpp
bmp.setSampling(Adafruit_BMP280::MODE_NORMAL,
                Adafruit_BMP280::SAMPLING_X2,     // temperature
                Adafruit_BMP280::SAMPLING_X16,    // pressure
                Adafruit_BMP280::FILTER_X16,
                Adafruit_BMP280::STANDBY_MS_500);
```

Pressure gets 16× oversampling and temperature 2×, because altitude
resolution depends on pressure precision and only weakly on temperature.
The IIR filter at ×16 suppresses the pressure spikes that airflow over a
vent hole produces.

## Altitude needs a reference

```cpp
bmp.readAltitude(1026.25);   // sea-level pressure, hPa
```

That argument is **local sea-level pressure on the day**, not a
constant. Get it wrong by 10 hPa and your altitude is out by roughly
80 m. Before every flight, read the local QNH and update it.

## MPU6050 — ranges

```cpp
mpu.setAccelerometerRange(MPU6050_RANGE_8_G);
mpu.setGyroRange(MPU6050_RANGE_500_DEG);
mpu.setFilterBandwidth(MPU6050_BAND_5_HZ);
```

**±8 g** is chosen because a model rocket's boost phase routinely exceeds
4 g — the EPS course's flight-profile figures show peak accelerations
around 9 g on a mid-power motor. Set ±2 g and your boost data clips flat,
and clipped data cannot be un-clipped afterwards.

**500 °/s** covers the roll rates a finned rocket reaches.

**5 Hz filter bandwidth** is aggressive. It smooths vibration nicely and
it will also smooth out fast transients you might care about. Worth
revisiting once you have a flight's data.

Sketch 12 combines both sensors and the SD card into a flight recorder.

```
Time,Accel_X,Accel_Y,Accel_Z,Gyro_X,Gyro_Y,Gyro_Z,Temp_C,Pressure_hPa
```

Header written once with `FILE_WRITE`, rows appended with `FILE_APPEND`,
timestamp from `millis()`, pressure converted with `/100.0F` to hPa,
logging at 1 Hz.

## Three things to change before you fly it

**1 Hz is too slow.** A 500 m flight lasts about 12 seconds to apogee.
At 1 Hz you get twelve data points on the way up. You want 50–100 Hz
through boost and coast.

**`millis()` resets on brownout.** If the battery sags on ignition and
the ESP32 resets, your time column restarts at zero and you will not
notice until you plot it.

**The file is opened and closed every row.** Safe against power loss,
expensive in time. At 100 Hz you will need to buffer and flush
periodically instead — and then decide what you are willing to lose.

Those three are the actual engineering content of this course. The wiring
is easy; deciding what to log, how fast, and what to sacrifice is not.

## The board this runs on

AfriOrbit's **MSU-avionics v0.1** (Edwin Mwiti, June 2024) carries an
**ESP32-WROOM-32-N4**, a **CP2102** USB-UART bridge, an **AMS1117-3.3**
regulator, an **LM2596S-12** buck converter, **16 MB of W25Q128 SPI
flash**, an **XT60** battery connector, a buzzer, three status LEDs, and
2.54 mm sockets for the BMP280 and MPU6050 breakouts.

Note there is **no SD socket** on v0.1 — it logs to onboard flash and
exposes a 6-pin *dump header* for post-flight retrieval. The SD sketches
target a breadboard setup. The schematic also carries two honest TODOs
from its author: *use a power MUX IC*, and *add XBee HP 900 MHz for
telemetry*.
