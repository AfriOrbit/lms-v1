/**
 * check-stale.ts — catch files that were deleted here but not in the repo.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Uploading a folder through the GitHub web interface ADDS and OVERWRITES. It
 * does not delete. So a release that removes files lands as a half-merge: the
 * new code arrives, the deleted code stays, and the two disagree.
 *
 * That happened with the /www marketing pages. `src/lib/site-config.ts` was
 * replaced with a version that no longer exports `SITE_URL`, but
 * `src/app/(website)/www/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` was still in the repository
 * importing it, and the deployment failed with:
 *
 *     Error: Export SITE_URL doesn't exist in target module
 *
 * Which is true, and useless. It points at the new file for not having an
 * export rather than at the old file for still existing, so the obvious next
 * move — add SITE_URL back — is exactly wrong.
 *
 * This runs in `prebuild`, which npm invokes before `build`, which is what
 * Vercel runs. So it fires on the hosting platform too, and it says what
 * actually happened.
 *
 * Run:  npx tsx scripts/check-stale.ts
